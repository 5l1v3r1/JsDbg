- box positions
- windbg links

- better tree drawing

- support past versions of IE in *Tree
- "private" fields -- when grabbing fields from others, mark them as private?

- type navigator
    - just click from one type to another and maintain history
- hook for pointer expansion?
- more aggressive symbol hunting when remote debugging?

BUGS

- copy-paste from IE results in newlines being added - opened BLUE 568186
- float over fallback is busted -- struct size is 0.
- tabbing in field-support shouldn't go to documentation
- GetLayoutAssociationFromCTreeNode -> doesn't work properly with non boxes because of linked list offset
- if pdb search fails with case sensitivity, try without case sensitivity before falling back to windbg
