- box positions
- windbg links

- better tree drawing

- support past versions of IE in *Tree
- "private" fields -- when grabbing fields from others, mark them as private?

- type navigator
    - just click from one type to another and maintain history
- hook for pointer expansion?
- more aggressive symbol hunting when remote debugging?

- make wide tree more useful on hover?

- Box Builder viewer
- auto refresh on break

- IDEA: add break on access support from the fields

- IDEA: visual tree creator
    - different types can have different children getters
    - some might fail, some might work
    - "code behind" model
    - build a new tree type, and save it as an extension

- NULL propagation in DbgObject
    - capture the field where it became null so that the description can inform it?
- TreeViewers should override descriptions for the types they know about

BUGS

- float over fallback is busted -- struct size is 0.
- GetLayoutAssociationFromCTreeNode -> doesn't work properly with non boxes because of linked list offset
