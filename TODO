- box positions
- windbg links

- support past versions of IE in *Tree
- "private" fields -- when grabbing fields from others, mark them as private?

- type navigator
- hook for pointer expansion?
- auto expansion
- more aggressive symbol hunting when remote debugging?

BUGS

- copy-paste from IE results in newlines being added - opened BLUE 568186
- when hovering, also expand horizontally if needed?
