BUGS

- when quickly checking/unchecking fields, order can be lost
- no way to get unsigned values
- CTreeNode.parent is horribly broken when clicking
- LineBox.Text seems to be failing on the reading list repro (bug 520492)

FEEDBACK

one feedback:  if a node has no box associateed with it, after an alert, maybe also need to clear the box
