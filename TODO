- box positions
- windbg links

- better tree drawing

- support past versions of IE in *Tree
- "private" fields -- when grabbing fields from others, mark them as private?

- type navigator
    - just click from one type to another and maintain history
- hook for pointer expansion?
- more aggressive symbol hunting when remote debugging?

- make wide tree more useful on hover?

- IDEA: add break on access support from the fields

- IDEA: visual tree creator
    - different types can have different children getters
    - some might fail, some might work
    - "code behind" model
    - build a new tree type, and save it as an extension

- automatic latest patch use for type hooking?

- default description should be clickable to dump fields

- see how expensive dependency loading is?

- make it more clear when content is loading (especially if it has been loading for more than ~0.5s)

BUGS

- GetLayoutAssociationFromCTreeNode -> doesn't work properly with non boxes because of linked list offset


NEWTREE
    - make namespaced types more attractive?
    - get rid of typemap for field-support
    - clean up contracts with the tree-inspector
