- box positions
- windbg links

- better tree drawing

- support past versions of IE in *Tree
- "private" fields -- when grabbing fields from others, mark them as private?

- type navigator
    - just click from one type to another and maintain history
- hook for pointer expansion?
- more aggressive symbol hunting when remote debugging?

- make wide tree more useful on hover?

- IDEA: add break on access support from the fields

- IDEA: visual tree creator
    - different types can have different children getters
    - some might fail, some might work
    - "code behind" model
    - build a new tree type, and save it as an extension

- automatic latest patch use for type hooking?

- default description should be clickable to dump fields

- see how expensive dependency loading is?

- make it more clear when content is loading (especially if it has been loading for more than ~0.5s)

- field-support: some way to refresh without having to click out of the box

IDEA: everything should be dynamically editable
    - code is data
    - enables experimentation -- no environment necessary
    - browser is the IDE for JsDbg extensions

IDEA:
    - when adding fields they become virtual fields on the type -- for example: CTreeNode.CharFormat
    - pipeline
        - dbgobject -> (array of) dbg objects
        - dbgobject -> html/text  (visualizers)

    - observation: tree view is just a watch window for a collection of objects

BUGS
    - browse other doesn't work
